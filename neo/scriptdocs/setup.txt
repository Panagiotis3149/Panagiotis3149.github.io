# Setup

{% hint style="warning" %}
You must install the Java Development Kit to create and use scripts!
{% endhint %}

## Installing the Java Development Kit

In order to compile Java scripts, it is necessary to utilize a Java Development Kit (JDK). By default, your system may be equipped with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installation, which is capable solely of executing Java applications but does not include the necessary tools for compilation tasks.

You may install the Adoptium Java 8 JDK [here](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u432-b06/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_windows_hotspot_8u432b06.msi).

## Setting the Java executable

{% hint style="info" %}
On Windows, the Java executable is typically located at

`C:\Program Files\Java\jdk`<mark style="color:red;">`<your-version>`</mark>`\bin\javaw.exe`
{% endhint %}

To configure the Java executable in the default Minecraft Launcher, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "Installations" tab in the launcher interface.
2. Locate the launch profile for which you want to set the Java executable.
3. On the right-hand side of the launch profile, click the button faced with three dots.
4. Select the "Edit" option from the drop-down menu.
5. Click on "More Options" to expand it and reveal additional settings.
6. Locate the field labelled "Java executable" within the "More Options" section.
7. Paste the path of `javaw.exe` corresponding to your Java installation into the field.

## Creating Scripts

* Raven scripts are coded in Java, which means your code must be in a `.java` file.
* The recommended approach is to utilise a code editor, such as Brackets or Visual Studio Code.
* All scripts must be in the scripts folder in order to be used. If the file name begins with an underscore, it will not be recognised as a valid script file.

## Using Scripts

* The GUI contains a category labelled **Scripts**. All scripts in your scripts folder will be displayed here.
* To add scripts, click the **Open Folder** button within the Manager module, and drag your scripts into the folder.
* It is essential to remember that whenever you introduce a new script or make modifications to an existing one, it is crucial to press the **Load Scripts** button to successfully apply new changes.
* If there is an error within the script, it will appear in <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> and cannot be enabled. An error message will also be displayed in the chat window, providing specific details about the encountered issue.
